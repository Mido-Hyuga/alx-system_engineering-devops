# Shell: Init Files, Variables, and Expansions

This repository contains projects related to shell scripting, init files, variables, and expansions. The projects utilize various commands and concepts, including the following:

## Command List:

- `printenv`: This command is used to print the values of environment variables.

- `set`: It is used to set shell options and positional parameters.

- `unset`: This command is used to unset shell variables and functions.

- `export`: It is used to export variables to the environment to make them available to child processes.

- `alias`: This command is used to create aliases for other commands or command sequences.

- `unalias`: It is used to remove aliases previously defined with the `alias` command.

- `.` (dot): This command is used to execute commands from a file in the current shell context.

- `source`: It is used to execute commands from a file in the current shell context (equivalent to `.`).

- `printf`: This command is used to format and print data.

## Project Structure:

Each project in this repository focuses on different aspects of shell scripting, init files, variables, and expansions. The projects are organized as follows:

1. **Shell Initialization Files**:
   - Description: This project explores the initialization files used by different shells (`bashrc`, `bash_profile`, etc.) and their purposes.
   - Commands Used: `.`, `source`, `export`, `alias`, `unalias`

2. **Working with Variables**:
   - Description: This project demonstrates the use of variables in shell scripts, including variable assignment, variable expansion, and environment variables.
   - Commands Used: `printenv`, `set`, `unset`, `export`

3. **Shell Expansions and Substitutions**:
   - Description: This project covers various shell expansions and substitutions, such as parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and more.
   - Commands Used: `printf`, `set`, `$(...)`, `$((...))`, `${...}`, etc.

## Usage:
