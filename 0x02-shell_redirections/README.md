# Shell, I/O Redirections, and Filters

This repository contains projects related to Shell scripting, I/O redirections, and various filters commonly used in Unix-based systems. Each project focuses on different aspects of shell commands and explores the functionalities of essential commands such as `echo`, `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `find`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `grep`, `tr`, `rev`, `cut`, and `passwd`.
